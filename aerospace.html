    <h1>Air at High Altitudes</h1>
        Aerospace engineering is all about designing objects that will achieve high altitudes. No 
        discussion on aerospace engineering could be complete without the atmosphere at high altitudes. 
        Because the weather is constantly changing, aerospace engineers use a table of values that 
        represent the average atmospheric conditions at various altitudes assuming perfect weather. 
        It's called <i>The Standard Atmosphere</i>.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Reading the data from <i>The Standard Atmosphere</i></h3>
    <div id="content"><b>Simply Put: </b>Many times, pressure, temperature, and density are given as the altitude in 
    which those values could be found. Pressure can be given as the altitiude at which the air pressure would be at that value. 
    It's called the 'pressure-altitude'. Temerature can be given as the altitiude at which the air pressure would be at 
    that value. It's called the 'temperature-altitude'. Density can be given as the altitiude at which the air pressure would be at 
    that value. It's called the 'density-altitude'. <i>The Standard Atmosphere</i> only gives values every 500ft or 100km. 
    So if you have a pressure, temperature, or density value that falls between two points, you must use linear intropolation to 
    find the correct altitude value for the measurement. This is the equation for linear intropolation: <br>
        <big><i> h=h<sub>o</sub>+(T<sub>measured</sub>-T<sub>GVBMQ</sub>)•Δh<sub>table</sub>/ΔT<sub>table</sub> </i></big></div>
        GVBMQ = Greatest Value Below Measured Quantity

    <h3>Layers of the atmosphere</h3>
    <div id="content"><b>Simply Put: </b>The atmosphere can be grouped into four major layers. Some texts describe the speration of the 
    atmosphere into layers in different ways. This is the easiest way to approach the atmospheric layers from an aerospace engineering point of view:

    <h3>Air Temperature at Altitude</h3>
    <div id="content"><b>Simply Put: </b>Air temperature will decrease as the 
    altitude increases into the troposphere. It is a linear relationship. Between the troposphere and the stratusphere,
    the air temperature will be constant for several kilometers (or feet in U.S.). This is called the tropopause. As the 
    altitude increases into the stratusphere, the temperature will begin to increase. It will almost return to 
    the temperature at sea level. It is a linear relationship. Between the troposphere and the stratusphere,
    the air temperature will be constant for several kilometers (or feet in U.S.). This is called the stratopause. 
    Air temperature will begin to decrease again as the altitude increases into the mesosphere. It is a linear relationship. 
    Between the mesosphere and the thermosphere, the air temperature will be constant for several kilometers (or feet in U.S.). 
    This is called the mesopause. At altitudes in the Termosphere, the temperature will rise to very very high levels, much 
    higher than the temperature at sea level. There is are equations 
    that can be intropolated from the data in <i>The Standard Atmosphere</i> table but I do not remember what it is. 
    <br><br>
    <h3>Air pressure at Altitude</h3>
    <div id="content"><b>Simply Put: </b>Soon after gaining altitiude, the air pressure will drop dramatically. 
    As altitude increase the pressure will continue to drop, but at a much slower rate. There is an equation 
    that can be intropolated from the data in <i>The Standard Atmosphere</i> table but I do not remember what it is.

    <h3>Air Density at Altitude</h3>

    <h1>Aerodynamics</h1>
    An object moving through the air will have the same result as the same air moving over an object as 
        long as the similarity parameters are the same. This allows engineers to create scale models and test 
        them in wind tunnels. There are two similarity parameters that must be the same for every wind tunnel simulation.<br>
    <h3>Mach Number (Similarity Parameter 1)</h3>
    <div id="content"><b>Simply Put: </b>The mach number tells you how fast an object is moving relative to the 
    speed of sound in that gas. A mach number of .3 means that the object is traveling at 30% of speed of sound.
    If the mach number is lass than .3, the flow is considered 'incompressible'. If the mach number is greater than 
    .3, the flow is considered 'compressible'. If the Mach number is less than 1, the flow is subsonic. If the Mach 
    number is greater than 1 the flow is supersonic. If the Mach number is greater than 3, the flow is considered 
    supersonic. The mach number is literally the ratio of the flow speed to the The speed of sound is the root of the product of the temperature of the gas, the 
    specific gas constant for the gas, and the ratio of specific heats for the gas (γ). <br>

    <h3>The Effects of Speed</h3>
    <div id="content"><b>Simply Put: </b>The faster a fluid is traveling, the lower it's static pressure will become.
        Becuase pressure is proportional to temperature (Gay-Lussac Law), the fluid cool as well. 
        At any speed higher than Mach .3, the fluid will begin to expand. This is called "compressible flow". Despite 
        the name, compressible flow does not actually cause the fluid to compress at all. Instead the fluid will expand, 
        leading to a drop in fluid density. <br>
        <b>Bottom Line: </b>The Gay-Lussac Law and Boyle's Law no longer apply when the fluid is moving. The

    <h3>Bernouli's Equation (for incompressible flow only)</h3>
    <div id="content"><b>Simply Put: </b>The total pressure of a fluid is the sum of the static pressure of the fluid 
        and the dynamic pressure. Bernouli's equation is an aproximation. It will generate a result very close to what 
        would be measured in the lab, but will generate some amount of error. The greater the speed, the greater the 
        error. The error is so high at speeds above Mach .3 that the equation cannot be used in those conditions at all</div>
