                <h1>Could the internet become a Super Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
                <h3>Author: Jon Wilhelm</h3>
                <p>
                    In the recent increase of technology we are constantly creating devices to offload our thinking into a cloud. If there is a recipe that we want to remember we write it down, but what if we wanted to share it with a family member. In the past we would write the recipe down on paper and mail it to loved ones but that was too slow. We would then send a telegraph and again that was too slow, so we would call the person. Which this was pretty fast until you were disconnected by an operator because you had to share a line. Then the internet came along and you could send the recipe to anyone you wanted to include everyone if you so desired. For thousands of years now we have been recording information so as to not forget and to pass the information on to someone else. What makes now any different you may ask. In today's time information is shared that much faster. We are able to fit information into a smaller space. With this progression it is only a matter of time before we will make a brain implant that will link to the cloud. The cloud can be considered as the internet in its full entirety and where the internet contain almost all of human knowledge.

                <p>
                    If all humans had instantaneous access to all of human knowledge could we consider the internet human or intelligent. Or do we just consider the internet a vast database of information. In order for us to understand something we require knowledge and information to support the knowledge. So for example we have limitless information and then therefore limitless knowledge are we then therefore infinitely intelligent. Alright so now let's think how does the internet process our information. Well we upload 20 blogs with respective titles, the internet will then index that information just like a humans brain and will be available to anyone who inquires a search of that indexed information. Because the internet can perform this operation does that make it intelligent. I would like to say it does because it understands how to process the information for later search.

                <p>
                    In our brain we have clusters of neurons that either process information or store information. In the internet system we have the same concept. First we have the hard drives, they hold the information. We then have the CPU which processes the information stored on the hard drives. If we think about it, humans operate very similar to a computer as the computer operates off the principle of Input, Process, Output. For a human we can first compare the Input to our sensors: touch, temperature, taste, hearing, and sight. Next we have Process or in our case our brain. The brain looks for patterns or what we know as experiences amongst our sensors. Then finally we have Output, what we recognize as our behaviors. The action we perform based off an experience. As a side note our actions that are perceived as good versus bad can be compared to the telephone game. From generation to generation we pass on information but like in the telephone game sometimes information is lost or changed and in that event the message is changed. In every generation we change what is required of society. We also change our way of doing things but it is also up to us to determine what needs to be done (what is right) or what should not be done (what is wrong). This change is what we constantly discuss as right or wrong behavior.

                    Alright in this article I have so far described how humans and the internet can be intelligent. I have also described how they can be the same. If for example we do not have the instantaneous access to all of human knowledge and the internet does. The internet then understands how humans operate better than any human because it can process the large amount of information uploaded from humans. Could the internet be considered a Super Artificial Intelligence?  In the definition Nick Bostrom gave in his book "SuperIntelligence" he said, "Superintelligence argues that if machine brains surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could replace humans as the dominant life form on Earth." By this definition to me it means SuperIntelligence is when an intelligent system is able to process human knowledge faster than a human. This is the day we fear. We ask what will the computer/robot do with this power? I ask what will a human do with such a power if they had this ability. Brainstorming here I think people would question that person's methods just like they do when any one smart says something. For example when Albert Einstein published his papers there were skeptics questioning him, but we then proved him right. Then the negative side to his discoveries we developed the Atom Bomb. The positive we have nuclear power. How I see it this will be beneficial to humans and then how I also see it as do many others this is bad. Bad how? If we let computers/robots they will be able to design and build the creations it develops. We could limit the robot's intent by making humans the command authority for what we feel to be right vs wrong. The problem, humans can be influenced. This is further described by the "Turing Test". The <a title="Turing Test - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing test</a> is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Alan Turing proposed that a human judge would have a conversation with two people and a machine. The machine is designed to generate human-like responses. All participants would be in separate rooms and communication would be limited to text only. The test was to determine if the judge could tell the humans apart from the computer. In the reference to this test we can conclude the internet will be considered super intelligent when computers can indistinguishably influence humans just like how humans can influence one another.
