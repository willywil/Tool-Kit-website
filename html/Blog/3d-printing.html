                    <h3>Author: Jon Wilhelm</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recently 3D was one of the biggest venues at CES 2015. Printers were demonstrating their ability to print houses, circuit boards, and even food. Granted these are only a few, I wanted to explain what they are, why they are so popular now, and how you can get started with one. To find information beyond this blog see: <a title="3Ders - 3D Printing Basics, 3D printer, and 3D printing news" href="http://www.3ders.org/3d-printing-basics.html" target="_blank">3Ders.org</a>, <a title="3D Printing - What is 3D Printing?" href="http://3dprinting.com/what-is-3d-printing/" target="_blank">3DPrinting.com</a>, and <a title="MakerBot Thingiverse - discovering, making, and sharing 3D printable things" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/" target="_blank">Thingiverse.com</a>.

                        We are living in the age of 3D, where things are coming out from behind the glass or window for which we look through and into our reality. These printers are making this possible. Cellphones have became a extension of humanity, our creativity, and communication. Cellphones in their very existence are computers allowing humans to connect. A 3D printer is a device that takes a computerized three dimensional representation and extrudes a material layer by layer onto a platform. We have been capable of doing this for decades now, but because there has been royalty fees with patents and a poorly developed infrastructure it took decades to become popular. A printer requires machine code to know how it should move to accomplish a task. In order to create machine code we needed software. The most important requirement has been the cost of precision. In the 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s we had motors that could achieve precision in the microns or .000001 meters, but they were so expensive only industry could afford them. Then also those who did develop printers and hardware at a reasonable price patented it and forcing industry to pay royalty fees. Industries then choose to not buy into the technology because there were cheaper options on the market, like injection. Injection may be cheap for mass production but not for rapid prototyping which 3D printers are great at doing.

                        In recent years CAD (<a title="CAD wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design" target="_blank">Computer-aided design</a>) software has became really inexpensive. So cheap, your common hobbyist can afford to use it. Who are these hobbyist and where are they coming from? They are coming from the industry. In the 70s, 80s and 90s computers were getting faster and more capable to keep track of numbers and preform math. The people designing stuff "Engineers" every day bought computers and started to write programs at home/work and learned how they could use the computer at work to become more efficient at their job. Once they had their design digitize it was very easy to then control motors based off their design. This software quickly became very complicated driving up the cost and made it more difficult for the software to be used at home. Now that the common person can learn the CAD software and design things at home, they also want to rapidly prototype like they do in industry. This is again very expensive to order out. By buying a 3D printer you are internalizing that cost and making it cheaper to turn your imagination into reality.

                        Now that we know why these printers are so popular, how can you get started using one. You have two options, one download a preexisting design or make your own. In order to take the next step you need to ask yourself, "what do I want to make?" and "what material do I want to use?". These two questions will determine the type of printer, type of software you need, and material. Depending on what parts you have laying around the house you could build the printer at no cost, but chances are you will have to buy something. You could spend anywhere from $0.00 to $25,000.00 on a printer. Please browse the links above for more information on building, buying, and design of 3D printers. The level of precision will be respective to the price and type of material.

                        There are so many printers available to this date, I can not possibly name them all. But here are just a few popular ones I know of:
