                    <h1>How can We Create Peace with Knowledge?</h1>
                    <h3>Author: Jon Wilhelm</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recently I have been thing how can I solve world peace. In this thought experiment I first started by thinking of where peace by definition is greater and where peace is lacking. After careful thought I concluded knowledge to be related to peace. I am not trying to describe a utopia if you will but instead a decrease of violence and conflict. Throughout this article I will be trying to compare and contrast peace to knowledge. With this in mind let's think of a place where education is less frequent. In the middle east education is less common and what do you know there are frequent conflicts among the people. There is a constant battle of power and superiority. The farmers and other people in small villages know few things feed family and live to take care of family. Religion and other belief systems could be in place but all living creature know to find food, defend life, and reproduce in order to keep information alive. Over time we may change our methods of performing this process but the concept stays constant. In america we frequently have conflict. Many fights break out over food, relationships aka ability to reproduce, power/control, or even equality. From birth almost all humans are taught to collaborate, communicate, and to learn. Â When we collaborate, we develop bonds with people. We develop trust. We understand that person will help keep us alive. In the event that bond is broke and we no longer trust them, conflict develops. In schools we are not taught how to handle every conflict or battle, but do learn how to solve problems. We learn how to work through a problem until we reach a solution. If we focus too much on producing results and not the meaning of the content we will lose sight of the problem's meaning. Knowledge is a tool to conflict resolution. Knowledge is a understand of different ways to solve a problem. When going through school we do not just learn how to solve math or communicate more effectively, but instead we are developing a diversity of problem solving skills. From the point of conception we develop ways to communicate and for the rest of our lives we constantly try honing these skills. The question we frequently ask is not how to communicate but how to effectively communicate. We can answer this question in two ways. One way is through diversity and the other way is through experience developed with knowledge. If for example I were to travel the world talking to at least one person in every country, I will develop diversity in my communication skills. I will exposed myself to failure and more challenges. When you stay in one area like one city you are exposed to only the communication conflicts in that city. In the event someone who speaks a different language enters your city you will not have the experience to communicate with that person and conflict will arise. When we increase the general knowledge of society we are allowing for more conversation topics. We diversify the problems we can solve. So how can we solve world peace? I think if we share our knowledge and how we solve problems will diversify everyone's problem solving skills. The point is to learn that you do not need to throw a punch because someone cheated with your wife. In a situation like that communication broke down and they resorted to instinctive fight or flight. If that couple understood how to better communicate I do not think they would have been involved in that conflict or at least the conflict would not have escalated to that extent.
