                    <h3>Author: Jon Wilhelm</h3>
                    <p>
                        OK so I just watched the movie,Â <a title="Cappie" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/?ref_=ttco_ql" target="_blank"><em>Chappie</em></a>. I would say that movie was the most inspiring robotics movie to date. As I watched the movie, I was putting myself in the engineer's shoe and I felt like that could be my future. I feel like I could get to the same point but there would be some thing I would differently. Things I hope would change the outcome. Our future will have more robots because key thing that we learned how to do. We learned how to survive. We learned how to pass 
                        <span class="text_exposed_show">our knowledge down to each generation. I would like to also suggest that our fellow animals are becoming more intelligent too. I also feel that well will all hit a limit. Our fellow animals may have hit this limit but we humans may be trying to over come this limit. We may be trying to continue to live so as to never die. Our soul if you will never leave others. We do not want robots to take over our lives or harm us. Just like we never want a dog or cat to turn on us. I have some other thoughts in mind as well that could summarize a solution to world peace. Keep in mind it is incomplete and I would only provide a portion of it. Until next time</span>
