                    <h1>Getting started with robotics</h1>
                    <h3>Author: Jon Wilhelm</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>Are you a robotics enthusiast? Do you like the idea of robots in the future and want to build them? Building robots can be a very daunting task and very difficult to get started. Hopefully I can clear the air and simplify this for you. Lets start with some resources such as supplies.</p>

                        <p>Here are some websites:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a title="adafruit" href="http://adafruit.com" target="_blank">adafruit.com</a></li>
                            <li><a title="Sparkfun" href="http://sparkfun.com" target="_blank">sparkfun.com</a></li>
                            <li><a title="Robotshop" href="http://robotshop.com" target="_blank">robotshop.com</a></li>
                            <li><a title="Parallax" href="http://parallax.com" target="_blank">parallax.com</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are just a few I could name off the top of my head. Personally I like to learn about robotics through books.</p>

                        <p>Here are some of my favorite:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Robot Builder's Bonanza by McComb</li>
                            <li>Arduino Robot Bonanza by McComb</li>
                            <li>Robot Programmer's Bonanza by J. Blankenship and S. Mishal</li>
                            <li>Robot Building for Beginners by D. Cook</li>
                            <li>Intermediate Robot Building by D. Cook</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All these books are a great starting point for the gathering of material, design, and building of several robots.</p>

                        <p>So that is great, I have named all these sites and books but still have not completely answered the question, "How do I get started with robotics?". Well that is easy, first think to yourself what interests you most. Do you like the idea of water, wheeled, flying, legged, or no legged robots? Keep in mind, all these kinds of robots have their difficulties some more than others and as a beginner you do not want to start off with the most difficult one. The most important part of getting started is trial and error. Divide your end goal in to small projects and then take them one step at a time. One of the quickest ways people get frustrated and give up start with poor planning. For example, you want to make a wheeled robot that will follow a line. If you start with the frame before you know the size of your battery, motors, or control board may provide difficult challenges later on. When planning you want to think of the entire project and determine your constraints. Such as wheel size, frame size, battery size, or motor size. When you know your constraints you can then work on them in parts, such as building a mount for the motor. If you come across a subject you are less familiar, complete some examples. Lead up to what you want to accomplish. In programming we commonly do this with the "Hello World" program or in electronics "Blink LED". The point is to get something working and then modify what you have working. Once you have it working, apply it to your design.</p>

                        <p>All in all, if you want to build robots start by building something. If you get stuck, need ideas to get started, or want to learn more about robots, watch some YouTube videos, read some books, or visit websites. Robots can be very rewarding and fun. Good luck to you and let your imagination run wild.</p>
