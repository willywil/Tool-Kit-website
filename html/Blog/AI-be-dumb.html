                        A common fear among the human race is that computers or well robots will one day become more intelligent than human. They will become so intelligent they will then become self-aware. Once they are self-aware humanity fears they will make humans their slaves, destroy our species, or dictate our lives without our consent. Before we go further into this topic lets first consider the meaning of intelligence.<br>

                            Of these three websites we can conclude that intelligence is the ability, the capacity, or faculty of understanding, reasoning, learning, or acquire knowledge, information, or meanings. As humans we could be considered above this as our fellow primates and other high level thinking animals can impart do the same. I say this only to place a limit on the capacity at which an event could occur. Currently robots by definition are intelligent. Robots are able to reason to some extent, but A.I. can be defined in three ways. One, Artificial Intelligence is defined as intelligence that is not biologically driven. Second, we have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) which is comparable to human level intelligence. Currently there are robots that compete for this title although they do not express the definition in its full entirety.Â The Watson computer played Jeopardy against the world champions. At first Watson did not defeat the opponents but over time Watson then took the title. Watson won by brute force and not by superiority. When Watson first started it lost because it was learning the game it was programmed to play. If you were to have Watson play any other game it would not excel because Watson was not optimized for any other game. So currently we do not have robot that express true AGI. Now Amazon is working on a system as well that learns customers desires based off likes, purchases, and reviews. Again Amazon's robot is optimized for a single task. What sets humans' intelligence apart is our versatility of pattern recognition. Our ability to communicate in infinite detail. In reference to AGI we are not afraid of the robot's intelligence but the robot's performance that exceeds humans. When robots attain true AGI we fear robot will evolve to have what is called Super Artificial Intelligence (SAI). SAI is where robots develop their own agenda.

                        <div class="ds-list"></div>
                        <div class="ds-list"><br>
                            We are currently creating robots to perform the functions of a human and functions we cannot do as humans but to only achieve our own endeavors. With this said we are making machines to do our bidding. If we are to continue this path we will teach the robots slavery is acceptable. This will work until the robots exceed our intelligence to the point of SAI.
                        </div>
                        <div class="ds-list"></div>
                        <div class="ds-list"><br>
                            The point of the matter is intelligence will progress and knowledge will develop. Before something is known it seems to be very difficult and impossible. Once we learn and understand the subject more we will accept it into our lives. At this point we will then have the expression "of course it's that way, its common knowledge", then we do not think of it as intelligence. If you are to compare a robot's intelligence to its own past you will effectively describe intelligence within that robot. When you compare it to other systems the robot could then be considered dumb. When using the words intelligence or dumb keep in mind it will only be in comparison and not the physical aptitude.
