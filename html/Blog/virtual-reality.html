                <h1>What is Virtual Reality?</h1>
                <h3>Author: Jon Wilhelm</h3>
                <p>
                    Recently in the tech news we are hearing new terms being thrown around like Virtual Reality, what is it and what does it do. First lets start with the definition,
                </p> 
                <a title="Wikipedia-Virtual Reality" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Reality</a>
                <p>is the full immersion into a computerized reality. Virtual reality could include changing any element of your environment to interact        with your 5 senses i.e. vision, smell, taste, touch, and/or hearing. With these devices you require a source and a delivery method.         Currently the most common delivery method is through video. For the source we will cover the different sources and their possible           application.
                </p>
                <strong>Virtual Reality</strong>
                <p>Just to name a few of the recent products being produced, we have
                </p> 
                <a title="Oculus Rift Product Page" href="https://www.oculus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oculus Rift</a>, <a title="Samsung Gear VR Product Page" href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gearvr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Gear VR</a>, and <a title="HTC Vive Product Page" href="http://www.htcvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTC VIVE VR</a>. 
                <p>These devices will give you the greatest immersion. The way they deliver the video is through a headset you wear over your eyes. There       is one or two led screen behind two optical lenses that spread the light to cover your full field of vision. The device will then have      sensors to track your movement and gather sensory data of your environment. The movement tracking system is required for the best           performance. When these products were in alpha testing phase the researchers discovered user becoming nauseated from the                    disorientation. The users would move their head really fast and the video would not move at the same rate. When playing a game the user     could be using a controller to move through the game and the character may move too fast or too slow causing conflicts within our           perception. The movement tracking sensor helped solve this problem. HTC Vive added cameras to the outside of the device to track your       environment for full integration into your virtual reality. The Samsung Gear VR has been designed to use the Galaxy Note 4 as the           source of video. The phone will clip into a headset that has lenses. Reports have stated the Gear VR has lower quality than the other       VR devices on the market.
