                <h1>What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
                <h3>Author: Jon Wilhelm</h3>
                <p>
                    Recently in the tech news we are hearing new terms being thrown around like <a title="Wikipedia - Augmented Reality" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" target="_blank">Augmented Reality</a>. First lets start with the definition <a title="Wikipedia - Augmented Reality" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" target="_blank">Augmented Reality</a> is a computerized reality overlaying your real world reality. Augmented reality will allow you to interact with a 3D world overlayed on top of any surface within your tangible world. Like the virtual reality you still require a source and a way to overlay the content. The common method for augmenting reality is through video.</p>

                <strong>Augmented Reality</strong>
                <p>
                    Just to name a few of the recent products being produced, we have <a title="CastAR" href="http://castar.com/" target="_blank">CastAR</a>, <a title="Microsoft Hololens" href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us" target="_blank">Microsoft-Hololens</a>, and <a title="Google Glass" href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank">Google Glass</a>. These devices will provide the greatest interaction with your environment. Alright so what is this thing and how do you use it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    CastAR is a headset that has glasses and pico projectors. You first connect the video to the device, the projectors will display an image onto a retroreflective background, and the light will pass through polarized lenses into your eyes. How the retroreflective background works they use the same material that is used on stop signs and firefighter uniforms. The light reflects back to its source with a minimum of scattering. This feature will allow you to view your reality almost parallel to the surface of the reflective sheet. CastAR is off to a great start with their product accessories. They have developed a wand that has a light on the tip. This light will be picked up but the headset and act as a pointer. With the versatility of the retroreflective sheet you can place the sheet across any surface for your desired task. For example roll out the sheet onto a table to present a design to everyone who has a headset or play a video game on your wall or ceiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next we have the Microsoft Hololens, this is a head with a set of glasses covering your eyes. The image is displayed on the glasses overlaying the image regardless of your environment. Microsoft described the device to have a full computer integrated into the headset running their new operating system Windows 10 subject to release summer 2015. In their keynote they hinted toward being able to work on a task at your computer desk then move the task to your floor or table and including overlaying your task onto a current design. I really like the implications of this idea as an engineer. I want to use my hands to design products in 3D space or like they described in the video redesign a gas tank on a real motorcycle. Currently the Hololens is controlled by hand gestures. I am sure later down the road they will allow more methods of input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly we have Google Glass. Now Glass has been available for a few years now to anyone who wants to pay the $1,500 for one. They did this to mainly test the concept and see how the world reacts to the tech. Glass is about the same size and form factor of a pair of glasses except Google put a crystal in front of the right eye. The crystal sits a little above your field of view but where it is still comfortable for the user. The image size has been described to be about the size of a 20 inch monitor. In order to control Glass you have the option of using voice commands like "OK Google" or you can use your finger. If you are going to use your finger there is a touch sensor on the support arm. A single touch will wake up Glass and then a swipe will scroll through your apps and finally another tap will select that option. One of the major issues people had with Glass was the camera. So many were concerned if they were being recorded. Or they thought people would be googling while in conversation. Something people did do, they would watch videos and listen to them through the bone conduction earpiece. I want to use Glass to overlay information while I am designing a product or while I am cooking give me the ingredients or instructions from my favorite recipe. Unfortunately Google has stopped production for right now due to negative feedback from the community. One critic claimed the world is not ready for people to walk around with cameras on their face. Also they are wanting to bring the price down to a more consumer friendly point. I am looking forward to Glass 2.0.
